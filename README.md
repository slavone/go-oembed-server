# go-oembed-server

A small microservice to retrieve oembed data from a url and return as JSON.

The server utilizes the [Oembed provider list](http://oembed.com/#section7) from Oembed.com to support a wide array of services.

# Usage

Pass the URL you want to extract data from by passing the `url` parameter:

```
http://localhost:8000/?url=https://vimeo.com/205090959
```

Data is returned as JSON:

```json

  "type": "video",

  "provider_url": "https://vimeo.com/",
